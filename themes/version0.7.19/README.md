## This is a guide to teach you how to install old themes on your old panel.


1 - Start by downloading a copy of the desired theme installer with the following command:
```
curl -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ferks-FK/Pterodactyl-AutoThemes/v0.8.2/themes/version0.7.19/YOUR-THEME/build.sh
```
**Note that at the end of the link it says `YOUR-THEME`, change this part to the name of the theme you want to install.**

2 - After the file is downloaded, run the following command:
`bash build.sh`

3 - Now wait for the script to do its work.

## Informations

Old themes are no longer supported by the main script.

The main script will still restore a backup of your old panel.
